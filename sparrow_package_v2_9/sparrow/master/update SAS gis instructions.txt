Procedure to be used to update SAS/GIS so that it properly imports ARC coverages:

1. Locate the files gisimp_82.cpo and update_sas_gis.sas.

2. Rename the existing GISIMP catalog just in case you run into problems
   and need to reuse it.  In a Windows Explorer window, navigate to the directory
   in which SAS is installed.  Expand the GIS folder, then the SASHELP folder. 
   Right-click on the GISIMP.SAS7BCAT file, and select Rename.  Rename the catalog
   to something like GISIMP2.SAS7BCAT.

3. Load the program update_sas_gis.sas into SAS, modify the directory path for the gisimp_82.cpo 
   file and then execute.
